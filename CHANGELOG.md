# Change Log

## 2022.10.17

- Reduce `chrono` features to exclude the `time` dependency with the CVE.
- Break out several structs into their own modules. Everything is still exported by the prelude.
- Added `Leaderboard` to the prelude.
- Disable doctests due to not being able to ignore specific files *(in this case, the README)*.

## 2022.10.16

Initial release.
